One sunny day, she met a squirrel named Sam. "Hello, Ruby!" said Sam. "Do you want to play?" Ruby smiled and said, "Yes, let's play hide and seek!" Sam ran to hide behind a tall tree. Ruby closed her eyes and counted, "One, two, three, four, five!" She opened her eyes and started looking. She found Sam behind the tree and giggled. They played all afternoon until the sun started to set. Ruby and Sam sat together, watching the sky turn pink and orange. "What a fun day!" said Ruby. "Let's play again tomorrow!"`

Max always wagged his tail and barked happily when he saw the park’s big trees and green grass. One day, when they got to the park, they saw something new. A big, colorful kite was flying high in the sky! “Look, Max!” Lily said excitedly. The kite was shaped like a butterfly, with bright blue and yellow wings. Max barked and jumped up, trying to catch the kite, but it was too high. Lily laughed as Max chased the kite's shadow on the ground. They played together for a long time, running and laughing, until the sun began to set. Lily gave Max a hug and said, “I love our park days!”`

As he walked, he noticed a small stream flowing gently over the rocks. The water was clear, and he could see tiny fish swimming around. Tommy followed the stream until he reached a hidden pond surrounded by tall trees. Suddenly, he heard a rustling sound. He looked up and saw a family of deer drinking from the pond. Tommy stayed very still, not wanting to scare them. The deer didn’t notice him and continued sipping the water peacefully. After a while, they walked quietly back into the woods. Tommy smiled to himself, happy that he had found such a beautiful and quiet place. “I’ll come back here tomorrow,” he thought.`
